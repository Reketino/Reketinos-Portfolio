# Bear Even – Developer Portfolio  
Building things with Next.js 16, Tailwind 4, custom APIs and a UI that feels more like a tiny desktop OS than a traditional portfolio.  
Cycling, trail running, gaming and coding are the things that keep me moving — and this project is where I learn and experiment the most.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio that stands out and feels more like a creative playground than a brochure.

This project lets me explore:

- Animation & motion design  
- Component architecture  
- API integrations  
- Interaction-heavy interfaces  
- Creative layouts  
- Real-time data  

It represents me better than a simple static page ever could.
